    Legal
    -----

    This software contains portions of, or code derived from, SIMH, uClinux,
    and libgba. You must read and understand software-specific licenses
    provided in the LICENSES subdirectory before using this software.

    Prerequisites
    -------------

    You need an RK05 disk image of 5th edition UNIX in order to run gbaunix.
    The Makefile expects to find it as "disks/unixv5.dsk".

    You can obtain the disk image (after reading and understanding the
    license, and ensuring that you are eligible) from:

    http://minnie.tuhs.org/PUPS/

    NOTE THAT THE DISK IMAGE'S SIZE SHOULD BE 2494464 BYTES.

    Running
    -------

    If you only want to run gbaunix, without recompiling it, do the following:

    % cat unixv5.tmp disks/unixv5.dsk > unixv5.gba

    unixv5.tmp is pre-compiled gbaunix, minus the disk image. Once you
    concatenate the disk image, "unixv5.gba" can be used with a Game Boy
    Advance emulator, or on real hardware.

    Compiling
    ---------

    You need an ARM toolchain (such as devkitARM).

    Once you have the disk image as "disks/unixv5.dsk" , simply run make.
